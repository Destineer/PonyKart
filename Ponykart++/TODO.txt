# General
- Implement the TODOs in the code
- Convert the CurrentNamingScheme to a newNamingSceme with lowercase first letter for objects/functions/variables
- Find how to remove errors with vertex_program_ref and fragment_program_ref in the .materials files
- Make constructors explicit everywhere not doing so wouldn't make sense
- Fix the doc to be Doxygen in all the files. Add some when necessary
- 'if "Twh = Yes" in the options, derpy will not follow you'. Change Twh to something more meaningful ?
- Changelog says thas shaders are useless, and only there because knighty wanted them. Are shaders useless ?
- There's a MLP Racing folder in the MLPMA.
- "onEveryUnpausedTenthOfASecondEvent". Seriously? This has to be a joke. Formatting nightmare.
- Write proper build instructions for Windows and Linux.
=> Under Windows have all the dependencies's folders directly in C: (C:\Ogre, C:\Bullet, ...)

# Correctness
- Might want to check those float -> int conversions. Rounding is probably a good idea (instead of truncating), because floating point imprecisions.

# Ogre
- Maybe we could switch to 1.9/1.10, overlays are just moved to a subsystem that you can initialize in two lines. Check the porting notes.

# Optimisations
- Remember to remove D3D9 from the active plugins once you're done testing with it
- Fix the const-correctness when possible, and pass by ref when it makes sense
- Zip some ressources when it makes sense (big-ish files with good ratio)
- Delete all the files in ./media that we don't actually need.
- Index the (unordered_)maps with enums instead of strings when possible.
- In PhysicsMain::frameEnded, the physics is processed at fixed intervals (?), it's probably causing the physics jitter.
- Replace some calls of LKernel::getG by the pointer itself, when possible (E.g LKernel::getG<Ogre::Root> -> LKernel::gRoot)
- Only #include when necessary. Replace some #includes by forward declarations and pointers whenever possible.
- Try to use precompiled headers if possible. It would be usefull for our dependencies.
- Use emplace_back instead of push_back when adding temporaries. "No code is faster than some code."

# Compilation
- Is there a way to set up a build server everyone could use ?
- Find a way to build Bullet. Maybe another mingw/visual with static link, or changing the flags
-- MinGW 4.8.1 with CMake 2.8, with -O1 -DNDEBUG works.
-- Visual works, with full optimisations.
- CMake.
