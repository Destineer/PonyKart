# General
- Implement the TODOs in the code
- Fix the doc to be Doxygen in all the files. Add some when necessary
- 'if "Twh = Yes" in the options, derpy will not follow you'. Change Twh to something more meaningful ?
- Changelog says thas shaders are useless, and only there because knighty wanted them. Are shaders useless ?
- Next big thing to do is write the dayum GUI. We'll use CEGUI unless there's a last minute game changer.
-- First make a rough placeholder for the menu w/ working buttons so we can eventually load a level (!)

# Correctness
- Might want to check those float -> int conversions. Rounding is probably a good idea (instead of truncating), because floating point imprecisions.

# Optimisations
- Remember to remove D3D9 from the active plugins once you're done testing with it
- Fix the const-correctness when possible, and pass by ref when it makes sense
- Zip some ressources when it makes sense (big-ish files with good ratio)
- Delete all the files in ./media that we don't actually need.
- Index the (unordered_)maps with enums instead of strings when possible.
- In PhysicsMain::frameEnded, the physics is processed at fixed intervals (?), it's probably causing the physics jitter.
- Replace some calls of LKernel::getG by the pointer itself, when possible (E.g LKernel::getG<Ogre::Root> -> LKernel::gRoot)
-- Using the templated specializations is a better idea.
- Only #include when necessary. Replace some #includes by forward declarations and pointers whenever possible.
- Use emplace_back instead of push_back when adding temporaries. "No code is faster than some code."
