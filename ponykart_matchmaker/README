Instructions:
Note: these instructions are written for Arch Linux. 

1. Install python2, python2-pip and redis via pacman
	# pacman -S python2 python2-pip redis

2. Install redis-py
	# pip2 install redis

3. Start redis
	$ redis-server &
	
4. Configure networking and redis within server.py
	$ vim server.py

4. Start server
	$ ./server.py

This server takes an ip:port combination and caches it into a 
a redis database to be reported to clients later to search for
matches. 

The server accepts three types of requests:
	SRV_EST - Server establshed request. Should be followed by a semicolon
		and port such as SRV_EST;12345 
	
	SRV_REM - Server removal request. Should also be followed by a semicolon
		and port such as SRV_REM;12345
		
	CLT_REQ - Client request. Does not require any port number or semicolon
	
For testing purposes, currently the server is not compressing output to clients
using zlib, comment line 70 and uncomment line 71 to enable it.
